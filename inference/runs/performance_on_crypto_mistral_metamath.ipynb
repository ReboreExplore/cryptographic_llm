      "In cryptography, confusion and diffusion are two important concepts that are often confused. Confusion refers to the process of obfuscating the original message by using techniques such as encryption, substitution, and transposition. This ensures that the ciphertext is not easily recognizable to an attacker. On the other hand, diffusion refers to spreading out the influence of a single symbol or group of symbols throughout the entire message. This helps to protect against differential cryptanalysis attacks, which exploit correlations between plaintext symbols. \\n\\nIn summary, confusion and diffusion are separate and distinct concepts in cryptography. Confusion refers to obfuscating the message, while diffusion refers to spreading the influence of a single symbol or group of symbols throughout the entire message. \\n\\nLet's break down these concepts a bit further. Confusion occurs when the ciphertext is not easily recognizable to an attacker. This is achieved through the use of techniques such as encryption, substitution, and transposition. For example, a simple substitution cipher may replace each letter in the plaintext with a different letter, making the ciphertext appear random. Similarly, a transposition cipher may rearrange the letters of the plaintext to produce a ciphertext that is not easily recognizable. This confuses the attacker, making it difficult for them to identify patterns or correlations in the ciphertext that may reveal the plaintext. \\n\\nDiffusion, on the other hand, refers to the spreading out of the influence of a single symbol or group of symbols throughout the entire message. This is achieved through the use of techniques such as shifting, shuffling, and permutation. For example, a shift cipher may shift each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions, making the ciphertext appear random. Similarly, a shuffling cipher may rearrange the letters of the plaintext in a random order, making the ciphertext appear random. This diffusion makes it difficult for an attacker to identify patterns or correlations in the ciphertext that may reveal the plaintext. \\n\\nConfusion and diffusion are important concepts in cryptography, as they help to protect the message from attackers. By obfuscating the message through confusion techniques and spreading the influence of a single symbol or group of symbols throughout the entire message through diffusion techniques, the cryptosystem becomes more secure and resistant to attacks.\"}\n",

      "Hash functions are useful for determining the hash values of elements in a set $S$ that is too large to store. This is done in order to search quickly for a particular item. For example, if you want to check if a value is present in a large set, you can look it up in a hash table using the hash value. A simple hash function for a set of integers $S$ is $h(k)=k\\mod p$, where $p$ is a prime. This is a function that takes an integer $k$ and returns its remainder when divided by $p$. This hash function is useful because it maps $k$ to the set $\\{0,1,\\dots,p-1\\}$. If $S$ is the set of all integers between 0 and 1,000,000, then this hash function would map integers to a range of 1,000,000. Therefore, if we have a set $S$ containing 100,000 elements, we can use this hash function to map each element to a range of 1,000,000. This allows us to quickly search for a specific element in the set, because we only need to look in the hash table, which is much smaller than the set.  -\n",

Passwords are typically stored as hashed values to prevent malicious actors from gaining access to the original password.\n",
      "A simple example of a hash function would be the modulo operator. Given a number n, modulo n returns the remainder when dividing by n. For example, 5 mod 3 returns 2. This can be used to generate a unique identifier for an element in an array, as shown in the example below:\n",
