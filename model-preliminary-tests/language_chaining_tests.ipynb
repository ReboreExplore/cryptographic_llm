Answer briefly[/INST]  The Caesar Cipher is a simple encryption technique that replaces each letter of the plaintext with a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. In the case of a shift of 2, the encryption process would work as follows:\\n\\nPlaintext: HELLO, I AM GOOD\\n\\nEncryption:\\n\\nH -> G (shift of 2)\\nE -> A\\nL -> L\\nL -> L\\nO -> G\\n\\nSo, the encrypted text is \"GAGLGO\".'"
