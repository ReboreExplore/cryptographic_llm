"What constitutes the division of one non-zero integer by another?","When we express that a non-zero integer $b$ divides another integer $a$, it implies the presence of an integer $m$ where $a = mb$. Essentially, the division of $a$ by $b$ results in no remainder. This association is denoted as $b \mid a$.","rephr","math","numbertheory","cns"
"How is the division of -3812 by 15 conducted, and what are the resulting quotient and remainder?","The division of -3812 by 15 is performed through long division of the absolute values. After obtaining the result $3812 = 15 \cdot 254 + 2$, multiplying by -1 gives $-3812 = -(15 \cdot 254) - 2$, resulting in a negative remainder. To correct this, 15 is 'borrowed' from the quotient, yielding $-3812 = 15 \cdot (-254 - 1) + (15 - 2)$, simplifying to $-3812 = 15 \cdot (-255) + 13$. Hence, the new quotient and remainder are $-255$ and $13$ respectively. Notably, the quotient is negative, while the remainder is positive and less than 15. This procedure illustrates that the new quotient is the negative of the previous quotient minus one, and the new remainder is the difference between the divisor (15 in this instance) and the previous remainder.","rephr","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"Describe the process of dividing 3812 by -15, and what are the resulting quotient and remainder?","When dividing 3812 by -15, we apply long division with positive numbers. This yields the equation $3812 = (-15) \cdot (-254) + 2$. As a result, the quotient becomes -254, and the remainder is 2. This process illustrates the rule that the new quotient is the negative of the old one, while the new remainder remains the same.","rephr","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"Explain how to perform the division of -3812 by -15, and what are the resulting quotient and remainder?","When dividing -3812 by -15, we utilize long division with positive numbers. By adjusting the quotient, we derive the equation: $-3812 = (-15) \cdot (254 + 1) + (15 - 2)$, which simplifies to: $-3812 = (-15) \cdot 255 + 13$. Hence, the new quotient and remainder are 255 and 13, respectively. This process illustrates that the new quotient is obtained by adding one to the old quotient, while the new remainder is the difference between the old divisor (which is 15 in this case) and the old remainder.","rephr","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"Determine the validity of the following statement without performing the actual computation: Does 3 divide the expression $3 \cdot 3262 + 2$?","The assertion that 3 divides $3 \cdot 3262 + 2$ is incorrect. We have a theorem which states that if $d$ divides both integers $a$ and $b$, then $d$ will also divide any linear combination of $a$ and $b$, denoted as $ax+by$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers, we observe that 3 divides $3 \cdot 3262$, but it does not divide the entire expression $3 \cdot 3262 + 2$. Thus, the accurate assessment is that 3 does not divide $3 \cdot 3262 + 2$.","rephr","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"If $d$ divides the integers $a$, $b$, and $c$, does it also divide their sum $a + b + c$? Provide a justification.","Indeed, $d$ divides $a + b + c$. We know that if $d$ divides both integers $a$ and $b$, then $d$ will also divide any linear combination of $a$ and $b$, represented as $ax + by$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. Since $d$ divides $a$, $d$ divides $b$, and $d$ divides $c$, it logically follows that $d$ will also divide their sum $a + b + c$. Therefore, $d$ divides $a + b + c$.","rephr","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"Given that 11 divides 66 and 66 divides 198, can we conclude that 11 also divides 198?","Given \( 11 | 66 \) and \( 66 | 198 \), where \( 11 | 66 \) implies there exists an integer \( m_1 \) such that \( 66 = 11 \cdot m_1 \), and \( 66 | 198 \) implies there exists an integer \( m_2 \) such that \( 198 = 66 \cdot m_2 \), we aim to demonstrate whether \( 11 | 198 \). Starting with \( 66 = 11 \cdot m_1 \), substituting this into \( 198 = 66 \cdot m_2 \) yields \( 198 = (11 \cdot m_1) \cdot m_2 \). Simplifying this gives \( 198 = 11 \cdot (m_1 \cdot m_2) \), where \( m_1 \cdot m_2 \) is an integer denoted as \( m_3 \). Hence, \( 198 = 11 \cdot m_3 \), confirming that \( 11 \) indeed divides \( 198 \).","rephr","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"Is 2 a part of the rational number set?","Yes, 2 indeed belongs to the rational number set. Rational numbers are those that can be represented as fractions, where both the numerator and denominator are integers and the denominator is not zero. In this case, 2 can be written as \( \frac{2}{1} \), meeting the criteria of a rational number.","rephr","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
