"​How many different 7-place license plates are possible if the first 3 places are to be occupied by letters and the final 4 by numbers and repetition among letters or numbers were prohibited?​","To calculate the number of possible license plates while prohibiting repetition among letters or numbers, we have 26 choices for the first letter, 25 choices for the second letter (since repetition is prohibited), and 24 choices for the third letter. Similarly, for the numbers, we have 10 choices for the first number, 9 choices for the second number, 8 choices for the third number, and 7 choices for the fourth number. Multiplying these choices together, we get $26 \cdot 25 \cdot 24 \cdot 10 \cdot 9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 = 78,624,000$ possible license plates.","orig","math","probability","fcp"

"How many possible permutations are there for a set of 3 objects?","The number of possible permutations can be obtained using the basic principle, where each object is arranged in a sequence. For a set of 3 objects, the first object can be chosen from any of the 3, the second object from the remaining 2, and the third object is then the remaining 1. Thus, there are $3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 6$ possible permutations.","orig","math","probability","fcp"
"Suppose now that we have n objects. How many different permutations are possible?","The reasoning behind this is that for the first position, we have n choices. For the second position, there are (n - 1) choices remaining, and for the third position, there are (n - 2) choices remaining, and so on until the last position, which has 1 choice remaining. Multiplying these choices together, we get $n(n-1)(n-2)\ldots 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = n!$ different permutations of the n objects.","orig","math","probability","fcp"
"How many different batting orders are possible for a baseball team consisting of 9 players?","To determine the number of possible batting orders, we consider that for the first position, any of the 9 players can bat. Once the first player is chosen, there are 8 players remaining for the second position. Continuing this process, for each subsequent position, the number of available players decreases by 1. Therefore, the total number of possible batting orders is the product of the number of choices for each position, which is $9 \cdot 8 \cdot 7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5 \cdot 4 \cdot 3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1 = 9! = 362,880$. So, there are 362,880 possible batting orders for the team.","orig","math","probability","fcp"
"How many different rankings are possible for the class in probability theory consisting of 6 sophomores and 4 juniors?","Each ranking corresponds to a particular ordered arrangement of the 10 students. Therefore, the number of different rankings possible is $10! = 3,628,800$.","orig","math","probability","fcp"
"How many different rankings are possible for the class in probability theory consisting of 6 sophomores and 4 juniors,if the sophomores are ranked just among themselves and the juniors just among themselves?","Since there are $6!$ possible rankings of the sophomores among themselves and $4!$ possible rankings of the juniors among themselves, it follows from the basic principle of counting that there are $(6!)(4!) = (720)(24) = 17,280$ possible rankings in this case.","orig","math","probability","fcp"
"Ms. Jones has 10 books that she is going to put on her bookshelf. Of these, 4 are mathematics books, 3 are chemistry books, 2 are history books, and 1 is a language book. Ms. Jones wants to arrange her books so that all the books dealing with the same subject are together on the shelf. How many different arrangements are possible?","To find the total number of arrangements, we consider arranging the books subject-wise. For the mathematics books, there are \(4!\) ways to arrange them among themselves. For the chemistry books, there are \(3!\) ways to arrange them among themselves. For the history books, there are \(2!\) ways to arrange them among themselves. For the language book, there is only \(1!\) way to arrange it among itself. Since each group of books can be arranged independently, we multiply these counts together. Additionally, there are \(4!\) possible orderings of the subjects themselves.Therefore, the total number of different arrangements possible is \(4! \times 4! \times 3! \times 2! \times 1! = 6912\).","orig","math","probability","fcp"
"How many different letter arrangements can be formed from the letters PEPPER?","To find the total number of arrangements, we start with the observation that there are \(6!\) permutations of the letters \(P_1E_1P_2P_3E_2R\) when each letter is considered distinct. However, since the letters E and P are repeated, we must account for the number of repetitions.If we consider any one of these permutations, such as \(P_1P_2E_1P_3E_2R\), and permute the P's among themselves and the E's among themselves, the resultant arrangement would still be of the form PEPPER. Therefore, for each distinct permutation, there are \(3! \times 2!\) equivalent arrangements.Hence, the total number of different letter arrangements is given by \(\frac{6!}{3! \times 2!} = 60\).","orig","math","probability","fcp"

"In a chess tournament with 10 competitors, 4 are Russian, 3 are from the United States, 2 are from Great Britain, and 1 is from Brazil. If the tournament result lists just the nationalities of the players in the order in which they placed, how many outcomes are possible?","Let's elaborate on how we arrive at the number of outcomes using a chain of thought approach. \n Firstly, each outcome represents a unique arrangement of the 10 players' nationalities. \n Given that there are 4 Russian players, 3 American players, 2 British players, and 1 Brazilian player, we arrange these nationalities in the order of their placement. \n For the Russian players, there are \(4!\) ways to arrange them among themselves. Similarly, there are \(3!\) ways to arrange the American players, \(2!\) ways to arrange the British players, and \(1!\) way to arrange the Brazilian player. \n By the fundamental principle of counting, the total number of outcomes is the product of these arrangements: \(\frac{10!}{4! \times 3! \times 2! \times 1!} = 12,600\). \n Therefore, there are 12,600 possible outcomes in the chess tournament based on the nationalities of the players listed in the order of their placement.","orig","math","probability","fcp"
"In a signal consisting of 9 flags hung in a line, we have to determine the number of different signals that can be made from a set of 4 white flags, 3 red flags, and 2 blue flags, assuming all flags of the same color are identical.","To solve this problem using a Chain of Thought approach, we recognize that each signal represents a unique arrangement of the flags. Since the flags of the same color are identical, we only need to consider the distinct arrangements of the different colors of flags. \n Specifically, we have 4 white flags, 3 red flags, and 2 blue flags. Using the fundamental principle of counting, we calculate the total number of arrangements as \(\frac{9!}{4! \times 3! \times 2!} = 1260\). \n Hence, there are 1260 different signals that can be made from the given set of flags.","orig","math","probability","fcp"
"How many different groups of 3 could be selected from the 5 items A, B, C, D, and E?","To find the number of different groups of 3 that could be selected from the 5 items A, B, C, D, and E, we reason as follows: Since there are 5 ways to select the initial item, 4 ways to then select the next item, and 3 ways to select the final item, there are thus \(5 \times 4 \times 3\) ways of selecting the group of 3 when the order in which the items are selected is relevant. However, since every group of 3—say, the group consisting of items A, B, and C—will be counted 6 times (that is, all of the permutations ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, and CBA will be counted when the order of selection is relevant), it follows that the total number of groups that can be formed is given by: \(\frac{5 \times 4 \times 3}{3 \times 2 \times 1} = \frac{5!}{3! \times (5-3)!} = 10\). Hence, there are 10 different groups of 3 that could be selected from the given items.","orig","math","combinatorics", "fcp"
"In general, what is the formula for calculating the number of different groups of \(r\) items that could be formed from a set of \(n\) items?","In general, the formula for calculating the number of different groups of \(r\) items that could be formed from a set of \(n\) items is given by \(\frac{n(n-1) \cdots (n-r+1)}{r!} = \frac{n!}{(n-r)! \cdot r!}\). This formula represents the number of different ways that a group of \(r\) items could be selected from \(n\) items when the order of selection is relevant. Each group of \(r\) items will be counted \(r!\) times in this count, hence the division by \(r!\) in the formula.","orig","math","combinatorics","fcp"
"A committee of 3 is to be formed from a group of 20 people. How many different committees are possible?","To determine the number of different committees that can be formed from a group of 20 people, each consisting of 3 members, we can use the combination formula. \n The formula for combinations, denoted as \(\binom{n}{r}\), represents the number of ways to choose \(r\) items from a set of \(n\) items, disregarding the order of selection. \n For this problem, we have 20 people from whom we need to choose a committee of 3 members. \n Using the combination formula, \(\binom{20}{3}\), we calculate: \[\binom{20}{3} = \frac{20!}{3!(20-3)!} = \frac{20 \cdot 19 \cdot 18}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 1140\] \n Hence, there are 1140 possible committees that can be formed from the group of 20 people.","orig","math","combinatorics","fcp"
"From a group of 5 women and 7 men, how many different committees consisting of 2 women and 3 men can be formed?","To solve this problem using a Chain of Thought approach, let's break it down step by step. \n Firstly, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 women from a group of 5. This is represented by the combination \(\binom{5}{2}\), which equals \(\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10\). Similarly, the number of ways to choose 3 men from a group of 7 is given by \(\binom{7}{3}\), which equals \(\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \frac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 35\). \n Multiplying these two values together, we find that there are \(10 \times 35 = 350\) possible committees consisting of 2 women and 3 men. \n \n Now, let's consider the scenario where 2 of the men refuse to serve together. Out of the 35 possible groups of 3 men, there are 5 groups that contain both feuding men. Subtracting these from the total, we have 30 groups of 3 men that do not contain both feuding men. \n With these 30 groups of men, there are still 10 ways to choose the 2 women. Therefore, there are \(30 \times 10 = 300\) possible committees in this case. \n Hence, we have calculated that there are 300 possible committees when 2 of the men refuse to serve together.","orig","math","combinatorics","fcp"
"In a set of \(n\) antennas, \(m\) of which are defective and \(n-m\) are functional (with all defectives and functionals indistinguishable), how many linear orderings are there in which no two defectives are consecutive?","To approach this problem, let's visualize the situation. First, let's line up the \(n-m\) functional antennas among themselves. Now, to ensure that no two defectives are consecutive, we need to place the \(m\) defective antennas in the spaces between the functional antennas. \n There are \(n-m+1\) possible positions between the \(n-m\) functional antennas where we can place the defective antennas (as illustrated in Figure 1.1 by carets). We need to select \(m\) out of these positions to place the defective antennas. \n Therefore, the total number of linear orderings where no two defectives are consecutive is given by \(\binom{n-m+1}{m}\).","orig","math","combinatorics","fcp"

Now, there are \(\binom{n-1}{r-1}\) ways to form a group of size \(r\) that includes object 1, since we are selecting \(r-1\) objects from the remaining \(n-1\) objects. Additionally, there are \(\binom{n-1}{r}\) ways to form a group of size \(r\) that does not include object 1. Since the total number of groups of size \(r\) is \(\binom{n}{r}\), Pascal's identity holds true. \n","orig","math","combinatorics","fcp"

"How many subsets are there of a set consisting of \(n\) elements?","To determine the number of subsets of a set with \(n\) elements, we can utilize the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \((a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\). If we consider \(a = b = 1\), then \((1+1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} 1^{n-k} 1^k = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}\). This equals the total number of subsets, which is \(2^n\).

For each choice of the first group, there are \(\left(\begin{array}{c}n-n_1 \\ n_2\end{array}\right)\) possible choices for the second group, and so on.

Here, we focus solely on the division into two groups of 5 children each. \n To find the total number of possible divisions, we utilize the concept of combinations. We calculate the number of ways to select 5 children from the total of 10 to form the first group, which is the same as the number of ways to choose the remaining 5 children for the second group. \n Using the combination formula, we find that there are $\frac{10!}{5!5!}$ ways to divide the children into two teams.

From this point of view, there are $\left(\begin{array}{c}11 \\ 3\end{array}\right) = 165$ outcomes in the sample space. Now, each set of 3 balls corresponds to \(3!\) outcomes when the order of selection is noted. As a result, if all outcomes are assumed equally likely when the order of selection is noted, then they remain equally likely when the outcome is taken to be the unordered set of selected balls. Hence, using the latter representation of the experiment, we see that the desired probability is \(\frac{\left(\begin{array}{l}6 \\ 1\end{array}\right) \cdot \left(\begin{array}{l}5 \\ 2\end{array}\right)}{\left(\begin{array}{c}11 \\ 3\end{array}\right)} = \frac{4}{11}\).","orig","math","probability","fcp"
"Given a group of 6 men and 9 women, a committee of 5 is to be randomly selected. What is the probability that the committee consists of 3 men and 2 women?","Considering the selection process, where we aim to form a committee of 5 individuals from a pool consisting of 6 men and 9 women, we're tasked with finding the probability of having 3 men and 2 women in the committee. \n To compute this probability, we first note that each committee of 5 individuals is equally likely to be selected from the total pool of 15 people. Therefore, the denominator represents the total number of possible committees, calculated as $\left(\begin{array}{c}15 \\ 5\end{array}\right)$. \n For the numerator, we calculate the number of ways to select 3 men from the 6 available and 2 women from the 9 available. This gives us $\left(\begin{array}{l}6 \\ 3\end{array}\right)$ for the men and $\left(\begin{array}{l}9 \\ 2\end{array}\right)$ for the women. \n Hence, the probability of selecting a committee with 3 men and 2 women is $\frac{\left(\begin{array}{l}6 \\ 3\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{l}9 \\ 2\end{array}\right)}{\left(\begin{array}{c}15 \\ 5\end{array}\right)} = \frac{240}{1001}$. This indicates that out of all possible committees, there is a $\frac{240}{1001}$ chance of selecting one with 3 men and 2 women.","orig","math","probability","fcp"
