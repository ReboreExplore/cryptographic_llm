"What does it mean for one nonzero integer to divide another?","When we say that a nonzero integer $b$ divides another integer $a$, it means that there exists an integer $m$ such that $a = mb$. In other words, there is no remainder when $a$ is divided by $b$. This relationship is denoted by $b \mid a$.","orig","math","numbertheory","cns"

"How is the division of -3812 by 15 performed, and what is the resulting quotient and remainder?","The division of -3812 by 15 is carried out by performing the long division of the positive numbers. When the obtained result of $3812 = 15 \cdot 254 + 2$ is multiplied by -1, it yields $-3812 = -(15 \cdot 254) - 2$, which leads to a negative remainder. To rectify this, 15 is 'borrowed' from the quotient, resulting in $-3812 = 15 \cdot (-254 - 1) + (15 - 2)$, which simplifies to $-3812 = 15 \cdot (-255) + 13$. Consequently, the new quotient and remainder are $-255$ and $13$, respectively. It is noteworthy that the quotient is negative, while the remainder is positive and less than 15. This process demonstrates that the new quotient is the negative of the old quotient minus one, and the new remainder is the difference between the divisor (15 in this case) and the old remainder.","orig","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"How is the division of 3812 by -15 performed, and what are the resulting quotient and remainder?","To divide 3812 by -15, we perform the long division of the positive numbers. Upon carrying out the division, we immediately obtain: $3812 = (-15) \cdot (-254) + 2$ So, the new quotient and remainder are, respectively, -254 and 2. This is, again, how it works in general. The new quotient is the negative of the old one, and the new remainder is equal to the old one.","orig","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"How is the division of -3812 by -15 performed, and what are the resulting quotient and remainder?","To divide -3812 by -15, we once again perform the long division of the positive numbers. By borrowing from the quotient, we obtain: $-3812 = (-15) \cdot (254 + 1) + (15 - 2)$, which simplifies to: $-3812 = (-15) \cdot 255 + 13$. Therefore, the new quotient and remainder are 255 and 13, respectively. This process demonstrates that the new quotient is the old plus one, and the new remainder is the difference between the old divisor (which is 15 in the above example) and the old remainder.","orig","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"Determine whether the following statement is true or false without performing the actual computation: Is it true that 3 divides the expression $3 \cdot 3262 + 2$?","The statement that 3 divides $3 \cdot 3262 + 2$ is false. By applying the theorem, which states that if $d$ divides both integers $a$ and $b$, then $d$ will also divide any linear combination of $a$ and $b$, denoted as $ax+by$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers, we can see that 3 divides $3 \cdot 3262$, but it does not divide the entire expression $3 \cdot 3262 + 2$.

Using Theorem 3.1, we observe that 7 divides $14 \cdot 407$ because 7 divides 14 and 14 divides $14 \cdot 407$. Additionally, 7 divides 21. Hence, it follows that 7 divides $14 \cdot 407 - 21$.","orig","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"Suppose that $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ are integers, and $d$ divides $a$, $d$ divides $b$, and $d$ divides $c$. Does $d$ divide $a + b + c$? Justify your answer.","Yes, $d$ divides $a + b + c$. This can be justified by applying the theorem, which states that if $d$ divides both integers $a$ and $b$, then $d$ will also divide any linear combination of $a$ and $b$, denoted as $ax + by$, where $x$ and $y$ are integers. Since $d$ divides $a$, $d$ divides $b$, and $d$ divides $c$, it follows that $d$ will also divide the sum $a + b + c$. Therefore, $d$ divides $a + b + c$.","orig","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
"Given that 11 is a divisor of 66 and 66 is a divisor of 198, is it true that 11 is a divisor of 198?","Given that \( 11 | 66 \) and \( 66 | 198 \).\( 11 | 66 \) means there exists an integer \( m_1 \) such that \( 66 = 11 \cdot m_1 \). and \( 66 | 198 \) means there exists an integer \( m_2 \) such that \( 198 = 66 \cdot m_2 \). We need to show that \( 11 | 198 \). \n From the first equation, we can express \( 66 \) in terms of \( 11 \) as \( 66 = 11 \cdot m_1 \). Substitute this into the second equation:$$ 198 = 66 \cdot m_2 = (11 \cdot m_1) \cdot m_2 $$. \n Now, let's simplify this:$$ 198 = 11 \cdot (m_1 \cdot m_2) $$ Since \( m_1 \) and \( m_2 \) are integers, \( m_1 \cdot m_2 \) is also an integer. Let's call it \( m_3 = m_1 \cdot m_2 \).Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as: $$ 198 = 11 \cdot m_3 $$ This implies that \( 11 | 198 \), as there exists an integer \( m_3 \) (specifically, \( m_3 = m_1 \cdot m_2 \)) such that \( 198 = 11 \cdot m_3 \). Hence, we've demonstrated mathematically that \( 11 \) divides \( 198 \)","orig","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"

"Apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the gcd of $134$ and $52$","Starting with the Euclidean Algorithm: $134 = 52 \cdot 2 + 30$, $52 = 30 \cdot 1 + 22$, $30 = 22 \cdot 1 + 8$, $22 = 8 \cdot 2 + 6$, $8 = 6 \cdot 1 + 2$ (GCD), $6 = 2 \cdot 3$. We then express each remainder as a sum of products of $134$ and $52$: $30 = 134 + 52 \cdot (-2)$, $22 = 52 - 30 \cdot 1 = 52 - (134 + 52 \cdot (-2)) = 134 \cdot (-1) + 52 \cdot 3$, $8 = 134 \cdot 2 + 52 \cdot (-5)$, $6 = 134 \cdot (-5) + 52 \cdot 13$, $2 = 7 \cdot 134 + 52 \cdot (-18)$. Therefore, $2 = 7 \cdot 134 + 52 \cdot (-18)$ since $\text{gcd}(134, 52) = 2$. The EEA gives us many nice results. We will now show a few of its applications.","orig","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"

"State the theorem defining prime numbers.","An integer $ p > 1 $ is prime if, and only if, whenever $ p = a \cdot b $, with $ a, b \in \mathbb{N} $, then either $ a = 1 $ [and $ b = p $], or $ b = 1 $ [and $ a = p $]. For instance, since $ 43763 = 107 \cdot 409 $, the theorem says that $ 43763 $ is not prime. On the other hand, if you look at $ 7 $, and $ 7 = a \cdot b $, we can see that the only way $ a \cdot b = 7 $ is if either $ a = 1 $ and $ b = 7 $, or $ a = 7 $ and $ b = 1 $.","orig","math","numbertheory","grad.pdf"
