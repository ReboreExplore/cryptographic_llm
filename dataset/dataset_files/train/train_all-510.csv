"Define encryption and decryption.","Encryption, also known as enciphering, is the process of converting plaintext into ciphertext, typically using an algorithm or cryptographic system. This ensures that the original message is hidden from unauthorized parties. Decryption, on the other hand, is the reverse process of converting ciphertext back into plaintext, allowing authorized users to retrieve the original message. These processes are fundamental in ensuring the security and confidentiality of sensitive information, especially in communication and data storage systems.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"

"Define plaintext and ciphertext in cryptography.","Plaintext refers to the original, unencrypted message that is understandable to humans. In contrast, ciphertext is the encoded or encrypted form of the plaintext, which is unintelligible without decryption. The conversion of plaintext into ciphertext is a fundamental aspect of cryptography, providing confidentiality and security to sensitive information during transmission or storage.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Could you describe plaintext and ciphertext in cryptography?","Plaintext is the clear, unencrypted message that humans can understand.

"What is the main security worry regarding symmetric encryption?","The primary concern in symmetric encryption is ensuring the secrecy of the key. While the encryption/decryption algorithm doesn't require secrecy, it's crucial to keep the key confidential for the security of the encrypted communication. Although decrypting a message based solely on the ciphertext and algorithm knowledge is assumed to be impractical, the security of symmetric encryption depends on protecting the key's secrecy. This aspect of symmetric encryption allows for widespread adoption, as manufacturers can create low-cost chip implementations of encryption algorithms without the need to hide the algorithm itself.","rephr","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Explain the components of a symmetric encryption scheme.","A symmetric encryption scheme involves five components:\\ 1. Plaintext: This is the original message or data in a readable form, which serves as input to the encryption algorithm.\\ 2. Encryption algorithm: The encryption algorithm processes the plaintext, performing various substitutions and transformations to generate ciphertext.\\ 3. Secret key: A secret key, independent of both the plaintext and the algorithm, is provided as input to the encryption algorithm. The specific key used determines the transformations applied to the plaintext.\\ 4. Ciphertext: The ciphertext is the encrypted output produced by the algorithm. It depends on both the plaintext and the secret key. Different keys will yield different ciphertexts for the same plaintext.\\ 5. Decryption algorithm: The decryption algorithm, essentially the encryption algorithm in reverse, takes the ciphertext and the secret key as input and produces the original plaintext. It reverses the transformations applied during encryption to recover the original message.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Explain the requirements for secure use of conventional encryption or symmetric encryption.","Secure use of conventional encryption or symmetric encryption requires two key components:\\ 1. Strong encryption algorithm: The encryption algorithm must be robust enough to withstand attacks by adversaries who possess knowledge of the algorithm and have access to one or more ciphertexts. Ideally, even with access to multiple ciphertexts and their corresponding plaintexts, the adversary should be unable to decipher the ciphertext or determine the encryption key. This requirement emphasizes the need for algorithms that resist decryption attempts, ensuring the confidentiality of the encrypted data.\\ 2. Secure key management: Both the sender and receiver must securely obtain and safeguard copies of the secret key. If an unauthorized party gains access to the key and possesses knowledge of the encryption algorithm, they can easily decrypt any communication encrypted using that key. Therefore, ensuring the confidentiality of the key is essential to maintaining the security of the encrypted communication.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Explain symmetric encryption.","Symmetric encryption, also known as conventional encryption or single-key encryption, was the sole encryption method utilized before the emergence of public-key encryption in the 1970s. In symmetric encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption processes. This contrasts with public-key encryption, where separate keys are employed for encryption and decryption. Symmetric encryption algorithms rely on the secrecy of the shared key to ensure the confidentiality of the transmitted data. While symmetric encryption is efficient and fast, its security hinges on the secure distribution and management of the secret key among communicating parties.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What is the principal security concern in symmetric encryption?","The principal security concern in symmetric encryption is maintaining the secrecy of the key. Unlike the encryption/decryption algorithm, which does not need to be kept secret, the key must be kept confidential to ensure the security of the encrypted communication. While it is assumed to be impractical to decrypt a message solely based on the ciphertext and knowledge of the algorithm, the security of symmetric encryption hinges on safeguarding the secrecy of the key. This characteristic of symmetric encryption enables its widespread use, as manufacturers can develop low-cost chip implementations of encryption algorithms without needing to conceal the algorithm itself.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What are the essential elements of a symmetric encryption scheme? Explain with an example where the plain message is \( X \) with \( M \) elements, encryption algorithm is \( E \), decryption algorithm is \( D \) and cipher message is \( Y \) with \( N \) elements"," The essential elements of a symmetric encryption scheme include the plaintext message, the encryption key, the encryption algorithm, the ciphertext, and the decryption algorithm. In a symmetric encryption scheme, a plaintext message \( X = [X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_M] \), consisting of \( M \) elements typically represented as letters in a finite alphabet, is encrypted using a key \( K = [K_1, K_2, \ldots, K_J] \). The encryption algorithm, denoted as \( E \), transforms the plaintext message \( X \) into ciphertext \( Y = [Y_1, Y_2, \ldots, Y_N] \), where \( N \) is the length of the ciphertext. This encryption process is expressed as \( Y = E(K, X) \), indicating that \( Y \) is generated by applying the encryption algorithm \( E \) to the plaintext \( X \) using the encryption key \( K \). The recipient, possessing the same key \( K \), is able to reverse the encryption process using the decryption algorithm \( D \), such that \( X = D(K, Y) \). However, an opponent, who only has access to the ciphertext \( Y \) without knowledge of the encryption key \( K \) or the plaintext \( X \), may attempt to recover either the plaintext \( X \), the encryption key \( K \), or both. This assumes that the opponent is familiar with both the encryption (\( E \)) and decryption (\( D \)) algorithms. Depending on the objective, the opponent may aim to recover the plaintext \( X \) or the encryption key \( K \), or both, in order to decipher the encrypted message.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Explain the basic procedures employed to convert plaintext into ciphertext in encryption algorithms. How do these procedures guarantee reversibility and enhance encryption system security?","Encryption algorithms primarily utilize substitution and transposition as fundamental operations. Substitution assigns each plaintext element to another element, while transposition rearranges elements. These procedures must be reversible to prevent information loss. Many encryption systems incorporate multiple layers of substitutions and transpositions, termed product systems. The reversibility of these procedures ensures the decryption of encrypted data, thereby bolstering encryption system security.","rephr","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Describe the fundamental operations used for transforming plaintext into ciphertext in encryption algorithms. How do these operations ensure reversibility and contribute to the security of encryption systems?","The fundamental operations in encryption algorithms involve substitution and transposition. Substitution maps each element in the plaintext to another element, while transposition rearranges elements. These operations must be reversible to ensure no information loss. Most encryption systems employ multiple stages of substitutions and transpositions, known as product systems. The reversibility of these operations ensures that encrypted data can be decrypted, contributing to the security of encryption systems.","orig","math","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What are the different types of encryption systems based on the key usage between sender and receiver?","Encryption systems are classified based on key usage between sender and receiver. If both parties use the same key, it's known as symmetric, single-key, secret-key, or conventional encryption. Conversely, if the sender and receiver use different keys, the system is referred to as asymmetric, two-key, or public-key encryption.","orig","math","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What are the different types of encryption systems based on the way in which the plaintext is processed?","The processing of plaintext in encryption algorithms defines two types of encryption systems or ciphers. Two common types of ciphers are block ciphers and stream ciphers:\\- Block Cipher: A block cipher processes the input one block of elements at a time, typically a fixed-size block such as 64 or 128 bits. It operates on entire blocks of plaintext simultaneously and produces an output block for each input block. Block ciphers often use complex substitution and permutation operations within each block to generate ciphertext.\\- Stream Cipher: In contrast, a stream cipher processes the input elements continuously, producing output one element at a time as it goes along. It encrypts individual elements of the plaintext stream using a keystream generated from the encryption key. Stream ciphers are often implemented using bitwise operations or simple arithmetic operations to combine plaintext and keystream elements.\\Both block ciphers and stream ciphers play crucial roles in modern encryption systems, offering different trade-offs in terms of security, efficiency, and implementation complexity.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What are the two general approaches to attacking a conventional encryption scheme?","Two general approaches to attacking a conventional encryption scheme are cryptanalysis and brute-force attack. Cryptanalysis relies on the nature of the algorithm and possibly some knowledge of the plaintext characteristics or sample plaintext - ciphertext pairs to deduce either a specific plaintext or the key being used. On the other hand, in a brute-force attack, the attacker tries every possible key on a piece of ciphertext until an intelligible translation into plaintext is obtained. On average, half of all possible keys must be tried to achieve success. If either type of attack succeeds in deducing the key, all future and past messages encrypted with that key are compromised.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Describe the most difficult problem in cryptanalysis.","The most difficult problem in cryptanalysis arises when only the ciphertext is available to the cryptanalyst. Even if the encryption algorithm is unknown, it is generally assumed that the opponent knows the algorithm used for encryption. In such cases, one possible attack strategy is the brute-force approach, where the cryptanalyst tries all possible keys. However, if the key space is very large, this approach becomes impractical. Therefore, the cryptanalyst must rely on analyzing the ciphertext itself, often employing various statistical tests. To use this approach effectively, the cryptanalyst typically needs some general idea of the type of plaintext concealed, such as English or French text, an executable file, a Java source listing, or an accounting file.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Explain the brute-force approach in cryptanalysis.","In cryptanalysis, the brute-force approach involves trying all possible keys to decrypt a ciphertext when the encryption algorithm and ciphertext are known, but the key is unknown. This method is often employed when the key space, or the total number of possible keys, is relatively small. However, if the key space is very large, as is the case with strong encryption schemes, the brute-force approach becomes impractical due to the enormous computational effort required. Cryptanalysts resort to other methods, such as analyzing the ciphertext statistically or using known plaintext-ciphertext pairs, to deduce the key more efficiently.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Explain the types of cryptanalytic attacks based on the amount of information known to the cryptanalyst.","Cryptanalysis encompasses various types of attacks based on the information available to the cryptanalyst. These attacks can be categorized into several types depending on the level of knowledge possessed by the cryptanalyst:\\ 1. Ciphertext Only: The cryptanalyst has only the ciphertext at their disposal.\\ 2. Known Plaintext: The cryptanalyst possesses both the encryption algorithm and one or more plaintext-ciphertext pairs formed with the secret key.\\ 3. Chosen Plaintext: Similar to the known plaintext attack, but the cryptanalyst can choose plaintext messages and obtain their corresponding ciphertexts.\\ 4. Chosen Ciphertext: The cryptanalyst can choose ciphertexts and obtain their corresponding plaintexts.\\ 5. Chosen Text: A combination of chosen plaintext and chosen ciphertext attacks, where the cryptanalyst can choose both plaintext and ciphertext and obtain the corresponding plaintext and ciphertext pairs.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Explain the vulnerability of the ciphertext-only attack and the importance of additional information in cryptanalysis.","The ciphertext-only attack is considered relatively easy to defend against because the cryptanalyst has only the ciphertext at their disposal, providing minimal information for decryption. However, in many cases, the analyst may possess additional information, such as one or more plaintext messages and their corresponding encryptions, or knowledge of certain plaintext patterns that are likely to appear in a message. This additional information, known as known plaintext, significantly enhances the cryptanalyst's ability to deduce the encryption key. For example, certain file formats may have standardized headers or recognizable patterns at the beginning, facilitating the identification of known plaintext. With this knowledge, the analyst can analyze the transformation applied to the known plaintext and potentially deduce the encryption key, thereby undermining the security of the encryption scheme.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What makes the ciphertext-only attack vulnerable, and why is extra data crucial in cryptanalysis?", "The vulnerability of the ciphertext-only attack lies in its reliance solely on the encrypted text, which offers limited insights for decryption. However, additional information, such as known plaintext or identifiable patterns in messages, substantially boosts the cryptanalyst's ability to uncover the encryption key. For instance, certain file formats may contain standardized headers or recognizable structures at the start, simplifying the identification of known plaintext. Armed with this information, the analyst can scrutinize how the known plaintext transforms and potentially deduce the encryption key, thus compromising the encryption scheme's security.","rephr","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Explain the concept of a probable-word attack and its relationship to known-plaintext attacks.","A probable-word attack is closely related to a known-plaintext attack and involves the cryptanalyst exploiting specific information or patterns within a message to deduce the encryption key. While in a known-plaintext attack, the analyst possesses explicit knowledge of some plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext, in a probable-word attack, the analyst may have partial or probabilistic knowledge of certain words or phrases within the message. For instance, if the opponent targets specific information within a message, such as key phrases or recognizable patterns, they can leverage this knowledge to narrow down the possibilities for decryption. For example, in an accounting file transmission, the opponent may be aware of the positioning of certain keywords within the file header, facilitating the identification of probable words. Similarly, in the source code of a program developed by a specific entity, there may be copyright statements or standardized phrases that aid in identifying probable words. By leveraging these known or probable words, the cryptanalyst can enhance their decryption efforts and potentially recover the encryption key, thereby compromising the security of the encryption scheme.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Describe a chosen-plaintext attack and its implications for encryption security.","A chosen-plaintext attack occurs when the cryptanalyst can select and encrypt specific messages of their choice using the encryption system. This attack scenario poses significant threats to encryption security as it allows the analyst to deliberately choose plaintext inputs that can expose vulnerabilities or reveal the structure of the encryption key. By crafting messages with strategic patterns or characteristics, the analyst aims to exploit weaknesses in the encryption algorithm or key generation process. For instance, the analyst may intentionally select plaintext inputs designed to reveal common patterns, repetition, or biases in the encryption process, thereby aiding in the deduction or inference of the encryption key. If successful, the chosen-plaintext attack can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted communication, undermining the security guarantees provided by the encryption scheme. Therefore, defending against chosen-plaintext attacks requires robust encryption algorithms and key management practices to withstand deliberate manipulation of plaintext inputs by adversaries.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Define unconditionally secure encryption scheme.","An unconditionally secure encryption scheme is one where the ciphertext generated provides no information that could uniquely determine the corresponding plaintext, regardless of the amount of available ciphertext or the computational power of the adversary. In simpler terms, even with unlimited time and resources, it is theoretically impossible for an attacker to decrypt the ciphertext without additional information. However, with the exception of the onetime pad scheme, achieving unconditional security in encryption algorithms is exceptionally rare.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Define computationally secure encryption scheme.","A computationally secure encryption scheme is characterized by the fact that the effort required to break the cipher—either in terms of computational resources or time—exceeds the value of the encrypted information or the useful lifetime of that information. In other words, while it may be theoretically possible to decrypt the ciphertext, the practical obstacles involved, such as the computational complexity or the time required, make it infeasible within a reasonable timeframe or with reasonable resources. However, accurately estimating the effort needed for cryptanalysis poses a significant challenge in practice.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What criteria do users typically aim for when selecting encryption algorithms?","The users of encryption algorithms typically strive for schemes that meet one or both of the following criteria: \\ 1. The cost of breaking the cipher exceeds the value of the encrypted information. \\ 2. The time required to break the cipher exceeds the useful lifetime of the information.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What is the objective of a brute-force attack in cryptography?","In cryptography, the objective of a brute-force attack is to try every possible key until an intelligible translation of the ciphertext into plaintext is obtained. This method aims to discover the correct encryption key when no information about the key or plaintext is available to the attacker.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"How many keys must be tried on average in a brute-force attack to achieve success?","On average, half of all possible keys must be tried to achieve success in a brute-force attack. If there are $X$ different keys, the attacker would discover the actual key after $\frac{X}{2}$ tries.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Why is recognition of plaintext important in a brute-force attack?","Recognition of plaintext is crucial in a brute-force attack because it helps the attacker distinguish between successful and unsuccessful decryption attempts. If the plaintext is easily recognizable, such as plain English text, successful decryption is straightforward. However, if the plaintext is not readily identifiable, such as compressed or encoded data, the attacker faces greater challenges in distinguishing between correct and incorrect decryption attempts.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What is the requirement for strong encryption in the context of data protection?","In the context of data protection, there is a requirement for strong encryption, which refers to encryption schemes that make it impractically difficult for unauthorized persons or systems to gain access to encrypted plaintext. Strong encryption ensures robust security measures to safeguard sensitive information.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What are the properties that make an encryption algorithm strong according to [NAS18]?","According to [NAS18], the properties that make an encryption algorithm strong include: appropriate choice of cryptographic algorithm, use of sufficiently long key lengths, appropriate choice of protocols, a well-engineered implementation, and the absence of deliberately introduced hidden flaws. These elements collectively contribute to the strength and effectiveness of an encryption scheme.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3" 
"What is a substitution technique in encryption?","A substitution technique in encryption involves replacing the letters of plaintext with other letters, numbers, or symbols. Alternatively, if the plaintext is considered as a sequence of bits, substitution entails replacing plaintext bit patterns with corresponding ciphertext bit patterns.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What is the Caesar cipher?", "The Caesar cipher is an encryption technique attributed to Julius Caesar. It involves replacing each letter of the alphabet with the letter standing $k$ places further down the alphabet.  This fixed number $(k)$ is known as the 'shift' or 'key'. Suppose we have the plaintext 'meet me after the toga party.'. To encrypt this using the Caesar cipher with a shift of 3, we would shift each letter three positions forward in the alphabet. So, 'm' becomes 'P', 'e' becomes 'h', 't' becomes 'w', and so on. Following this pattern, the plaintext 'meet me after the toga party' would be encrypted as 'PHHW PH DIWHU WKH WRJD SDUWB.'","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What is the Caesar algorithm?", "The Caesar algorithm involves assigning a numerical equivalent to each letter of the alphabet, where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, ..., 'z' is 25. Then, for each plaintext letter \( p \), the ciphertext letter \( C \) is obtained using the formula \( C = E(k, p) = (p + k) \mod 26 \), where \( k \) is the shift amount (3 for the classical Caesar cipher). 'k' can take a value in the range 1 to 25.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"Explain the decryption algorithm for the Caesar cipher.","The decryption algorithm for the Caesar cipher is simply \( p = D(k, C) = (C - k) \mod 26 \), where \( k \) is the shift amount, \( C \) is the cipher-text letter and \(p)\ is the plaintext letter.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What does “CAESAR” become with a shift of F, using Caesar Cipher?","To understand the transformation of 'CAESAR' with a shift of F in the Caesar cipher, we first need to establish the alphabet and the corresponding positions of each letter.

Now, with a shift of E, each letter in 'UNIVERSITY' is moved five positions forward in the alphabet. - For 'U': Original position is 21, Shifted position is 21 + 5 = 26, Corresponding letter is 'Z'. - For 'N': Original position is 14, Shifted position is 14 + 5 = 19, Corresponding letter is 'S'. - For 'I': Original position is 9, Shifted position is 9 + 5 = 14, Corresponding letter is 'N'. - For 'V': Original position is 22, Shifted position is 22 + 5 = 27, Since there is no 27th letter in the alphabet, it loops back to the beginning, resulting in 'A'. - For 'E': Original position is 5, Shifted position is 5 + 5 = 10, Corresponding letter is 'J'. - For 'R': Original position is 18, Shifted position is 18 + 5 = 23, Corresponding letter is 'W'. - For 'S': Original position is 19, Shifted position is 19 + 5 = 24, Corresponding letter is 'X'. - For 'I': Original position is 9, Shifted position is 9 + 5 = 14, Corresponding letter is 'N'. - For 'T': Original position is 20, Shifted position is 20 + 5 = 25, Corresponding letter is 'Y'. - For 'Y': Original position is 25, Shifted position is 25 + 5 = 30, Since there is no 30th letter in the alphabet, it loops back to the beginning, resulting in 'D'.

"What is a monoalphabetic substitution cipher in cryptography?","A monoalphabetic substitution cipher in cryptography refers to an encryption technique where a single cipher alphabet, which is a mapping from the plain alphabet to the cipher alphabet, is used per message. In the context of the Caesar cipher, each letter of the plaintext alphabet is substituted with a corresponding letter from the cipher alphabet, following a fixed pattern. For example, in a Caesar cipher, each letter is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet to produce the ciphertext. However, in a more general monoalphabetic substitution cipher, the cipher alphabet can be any permutation of the 26 alphabetic characters, resulting in a much larger number of possible keys. This makes brute-force techniques for cryptanalysis impractical due to the vast key space.", "orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"

In any case, the relative frequencies of the letters in the ciphertext (in percentages) are as follows: $P: 13.33\%, H: 5.83\%, F: 3.33\%, B: 1.67\%, C: 0.00\%, Z: 11.67\%, D: 5.00\%, W: 3.33\%, G: 1.67\%, K: 0.00\%, S: 8.33\%, E: 5.00\%, Q: 2.50\%, Y: 1.67\%, L: 0.00\%, U: 8.33\%, V: 4.17\%, T: 2.50\%, I: 0.83\%, N: 0.00\%, O: 7.50\%, X: 4.17\%, A: 1.67\%, J: 0.83\%, R: 0.00\%, M: 6.67\%$. From this information we can derive that it seems likely that cipher letters P and Z are the equivalents of plain letters e and t, but it is not certain which is which. The letters S, U, O, M, and H are all of relatively high frequency and probably correspond to plain letters from the set {a, h, i, n, o, r, s}. The letters with the lowest frequencies (namely, A, B, G, Y, I, J) are likely included in the set {b, j, k, q, v, x, z}. Despite the ciphertext being relatively short, this technique provides valuable insights. By analyzing the frequency distribution, assumptions are made regarding the potential plaintext letters corresponding to the ciphertext. The process involves iteratively testing different assumptions and identifying patterns such as common digrams and trigrams. The most common such digram is th. In our ciphertext, the most common digram is ZW, which appears three times. So we make the correspondence of Z with t and W with h. Then, by our earlier hypothesis, we can equate P with e. Now notice that the sequence ZWP appears in the ciphertext, and we can translate that sequence as “the.” This is the most frequent trigram (three-letter combination) in English, which seems to indicate that we are on the right track. Next, notice the sequence ZWSZ in the first line. We do not know that these four letters form a complete word, but if they do, it is of the form th_t.

"Why are monoalphabetic ciphers considered easy to break?","Monoalphabetic ciphers are easy to break because they reflect the frequency data of the original alphabet.

"How can the vulnerability of monoalphabetic ciphers be mitigated?","One countermeasure against the vulnerability of monoalphabetic ciphers is to introduce multiple substitutes, known as homophones, for a single letter. By assigning different cipher symbols to represent the same plaintext letter, the frequency distribution of individual letters is obscured. For instance, instead of consistently replacing the letter 'e' with a single cipher symbol, multiple symbols like 16, 74, 35, and 21 can be used, with each symbol assigned to 'e' in rotation or randomly.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"

"What is the Playfair cipher based on?","The Playfair cipher is based on the use of a 5 * 5 matrix of letters constructed using a keyword. This matrix, known as the Playfair square, is used to encrypt and decrypt messages by treating digrams (pairs of letters) in the plaintext as single units and translating these units into ciphertext digrams. The keyword determines the arrangement of letters in the Playfair square, ensuring that each letter of the alphabet is included once, except for the letters 'I' and 'J', which are typically combined into a single cell. The Playfair algorithm involves specific rules for handling various scenarios, such as handling repeated letters and pairs located in the same row, column, or diagonal within the matrix.

"What is the Playfair cipher and how is it constructed and used? Give example.","The Playfair algorithm is based on the use of a $5 \times 5$ matrix of letters constructed using a keyword. Here is an example, solved by Lord Peter Wimsey in Dorothy Sayers's Have His Carcase:\\ \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline $\mathrm{M}$ & $\mathrm{O}$ & $\mathrm{N}$ & $\mathrm{A}$ & $\mathrm{R}$ \\ \hline $\mathrm{C}$ & $\mathrm{H}$ & $\mathrm{Y}$ & $\mathrm{B}$ & $\mathrm{D}$ \\ \hline $\mathrm{E}$ & $\mathrm{F}$ & $\mathrm{G}$ & $\mathrm{I} / \mathrm{J}$ & $\mathrm{K}$ \\ \hline $\mathrm{L}$ & $\mathrm{P}$ & $\mathrm{Q}$ & $\mathrm{S}$ & $\mathrm{T}$ \\ \hline $\mathrm{U}$ & $\mathrm{V}$ & $\mathrm{W}$ & $\mathrm{X}$ & $\mathrm{Z}$ \\ \hline \end{tabular} \\ In this case, the keyword is monarchy. The matrix is constructed by filling in the letters of the keyword (minus duplicates) from left to right and from top to bottom, and then filling in the remainder of the matrix with the remaining letters in alphabetic order. The letters I and J count as one letter. Plaintext is encrypted two letters at a time, according to the following rules:\\ 1. Repeating plaintext letters that are in the same pair are separated with a filler letter, such as $\mathrm{x}$, so that balloon would be treated as ba lx lo on. \\ 2. Two plaintext letters that fall in the same row of the matrix are each replaced by the letter to the right, with the first element of the row circularly following the last. For example, ar is encrypted as RM. \\ 3. Two plaintext letters that fall in the same column are each replaced by the letter beneath, with the top element of the column circularly following the last. For example, mu is encrypted as CM. \\ 4. Otherwise, each plaintext letter in a pair is replaced by the letter that lies in its own row and the column occupied by the other plaintext letter.

"What are some advantages of the Playfair cipher over simple monoalphabetic ciphers, and why was it considered unbreakable for a long time?","The Playfair cipher offers several advantages over simple monoalphabetic ciphers. Firstly, while there are only 26 letters in the alphabet, there are 26 * 26 = 676 possible digrams in the Playfair cipher, making the identification of individual digrams more difficult. Additionally, the relative frequencies of individual letters exhibit a much greater range than that of digrams, further complicating frequency analysis. Due to these reasons, the Playfair cipher was considered unbreakable for a long time. It was even used as the standard field system by the British Army in World War I and continued to see considerable use by the U.S. Army and other Allied forces during World War II.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"

For $m=3$, the system can be described as $$ \begin{aligned} & c_1=\left(k_{11} p_1+k_{21} p_2+k_{31} p_3\right) \bmod 26 \\ & c_2=\left(k_{12} p_1+k_{22} p_2+k_{32} p_3\right) \bmod 26 \\ & c_3=\left(k_{13} p_1+k_{23} p_2+k_{33} p_3\right) \bmod 26 \end{aligned} $$ This can be expressed in terms of row vectors and matrices: $$ \left(c_1 c_2 c_3\right)=\left(p_1 p_2 p_3\right)\left(\begin{array}{lll} k_{11} & k_{12} & k_{13} \\ k_{21} & k_{22} & k_{23} \\ k_{31} & k_{32} & k_{33} \end{array}\right) \bmod 26 $$ or $$ \mathbf{C}=\mathbf{P K} \bmod 26 $$ where $\mathbf{C}$ and $\mathbf{P}$ are row vectors of length 3 representing the plaintext and ciphertext, and $\mathbf{K}$ is a $3 \times 3$ matrix representing the encryption key. Operations are performed $\bmod 26$.","orig","math","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What is the process of encryption and decryption in the Hill cipher, using a specific example and encryption key?","In the Hill cipher, encryption involves substituting groups of successive plaintext letters with corresponding groups of ciphertext letters based on a matrix multiplication operation. For example : consider the plaintext 'paymoremoney' and use the encryption key $$ \mathbf{K}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 17 & 17 & 5 \\ 21 & 18 & 21 \\ 2 & 2 & 19 \end{array}\right) $$ The first three letters. For example,  of the plaintext are represented by the vector (15 0 24). Then $(15024) \mathbf{K}=(303303$ 531) $\bmod 26=(171711)=$ RRL. Continuing in this fashion, the ciphertext for the entire plaintext is RRLMWBKASPDH. Decryption requires using the inverse of the matrix $\mathbf{K}$. We can compute det $\mathbf{K}=23$, and therefore, $(\operatorname{det} \mathbf{K})^{-1} \bmod 26=17$. We can then compute the inverse as $$ \mathbf{K}^{-1}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 4 & 9 & 15 \\ 15 & 17 & 6 \\ 24 & 0 & 17 \end{array}\right) $$ This is demonstrated as $$ \left(\begin{array}{ccc} 17 & 17 & 5 \\ 21 & 18 & 21 \\ 2 & 2 & 19 \end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 4 & 9 & 15 \\ 15 & 17 & 6 \\ 24 & 0 & 17 \end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{ccc} 443 & 442 & 442 \\858 & 495 & 780 \\ 494 & 52 & 365 \end{array}\right) \bmod 26=\left(\begin{array}{lll} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{array}\right) $$ It is easily seen that if the matrix $\mathbf{K}^{-1}$ is applied to the ciphertext, then the plaintext is recovered. In general terms, the Hill system can be expressed as $$ \begin{aligned} & \mathbf{C}=\mathrm{E}(\mathbf{K}, \mathbf{P})=\mathbf{P K} \bmod 26 \\ & \mathbf{P}=\mathrm{D}(\mathbf{K}, \mathbf{C})=\mathbf{C K}^{-1} \bmod 26=\mathbf{P K K}^{-1}=\mathbf{P} \end{aligned} $$","orig","math","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What vulnerability does the Hill cipher exhibit despite its strength against ciphertext-only attacks?","The Hill cipher, despite its resilience against ciphertext-only attacks, is susceptible to known plaintext attacks. In such scenarios, adversaries possess both the plaintext-ciphertext pairs, denoted as \( P_j = (p_{1j}, p_{2j}, ..., p_{mj}) \) and \( C_j = (c_{1j}, c_{2j}, ..., c_{mj}) \), where \( C_j = P_j \cdot K \) for \( 1 \leq j \leq m \) and for some unknown key matrix \( K \). By exploiting these known pairs, attackers can deduce the key matrix \( K \) used for encryption. This vulnerability arises due to the linear nature of the Hill cipher's encryption process, represented by the matrix equation \( Y = X \cdot K \), where \( X \) and \( Y \) are \( m \times m \) matrices formed from the plaintext and ciphertext pairs. If \( X \) is invertible, the key matrix \( K \) can be determined as \( K = X^{-1} \cdot Y \). However, if \( X \) is not invertible, a new version of \( X \) can be constructed with additional plaintext-ciphertext pairs until an invertible \( X \) is obtained. Thus, despite its initial resistance, the Hill cipher's susceptibility to known plaintext attacks underscores the need for robust encryption techniques in cryptographic systems.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"

For instance, a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 is denoted by the key value 3.", "orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"
"What is the process for encrypting plaintext using the Vigenère cipher, and how does it compare to the Caesar cipher?","The Vigenere cipher can be expressed in the following manner. Assume a sequence of plaintext letters $ P=p_0,p_1,p_2, \ldots, p_{n-1}$ and a key consisting of the sequence of letters $K=k_0, k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_{m-1}$, where typically $m<n$. The sequence of ciphertext letters $C=C_0, C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_{n-1}$ is calculated as follows: $$ \begin{aligned} C= & C_0, C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_{n-1}=\mathrm{E}(K, P)=\mathrm{E}\left[\left(k_0, k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_{m-1}\right),\left(p_0, p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{n-1}\right)\right] \\ = & \left(p_0+k_0\right) \bmod 26,\left(p_1+k_1\right) \bmod 26, \ldots,\left(p_{m-1}+k_{m-1}\right) \bmod 26, \\ & \left(p_m+k_0\right) \bmod 26,\left(p_{m+1}+k_1\right) \bmod 26, \ldots,\left(p_{2 m-1}+k_{m-1}\right) \bmod 26, \ldots \end{aligned} $$ \\ Thus, the first letter of the key is added to the first letter of the plaintext, mod 26, the second letters are added, and so on through the first $m$ letters of the plaintext. For the next $m$ letters of the plaintext, the key letters are repeated. This process continues until all of the plaintext sequence is encrypted. A general equation of the encryption process is $$ C_i=\left(p_i+k_{i \bmod m}\right) \bmod 26 $$ Compare this with the Caesar cipher. In essence, each plaintext character is encrypted with a different Caesar cipher, depending on the corresponding key character. Similarly, decryption is a generalization given by: $$ p_i=\left(C_i-k_{i \bmod m}\right) \bmod 26 $$","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"

A simple test can be made to make a determination. If a monoalphabetic substitution is used, then the statistical properties of the ciphertext should be the same as that of the language of the plaintext. Thus, referring to Figure 3.5, there should be one cipher letter with a relative frequency of occurrence of about 12.7%, one with about 9.06%, and so on. If only a single message is available for analysis, we would not expect an exact match of this small sample with the statistical profile of the plaintext language. Nevertheless, if the correspondence is close, we can assume a monoalphabetic substitution. If, on the other hand, a Vigenère cipher is suspected, then progress depends on determining the length of the keyword, as will be seen in a moment. For now, let us concentrate on how the keyword length can be determined. The important insight that leads to a solution is the following: If two identical sequences of plaintext letters occur at a distance that is an integer multiple of the keyword length, they will generate identical ciphertext sequences. In the given example, two instances of the sequence “red” are separated by nine character positions. Consequently, in both cases, r is encrypted using key letter e, e is encrypted using key letter p, and d is encrypted using key letter t. Thus, in both cases, the ciphertext sequence is VTW. We indicate this above by underlining the relevant ciphertext letters and shading the relevant ciphertext numbers. An analyst looking at only the ciphertext would detect the repeated sequences VTW at a displacement of 9 and make the assumption that the keyword is either three or nine letters in length.The appearance of VTW twice could be by chance and may not reflect identical plaintext letters encrypted with identical key letters. However, if the message is long enough, there will be a number of such repeated ciphertext sequences. By looking for common factors in the displacements of the various sequences, the analyst should be able to make a good guess of the keyword length. Solution of the cipher now depends on an important insight. If the keyword length is m, then the cipher, in effect, consists of m monoalphabetic substitution ciphers. For example, with the keyword DECEPTIVE, the letters in positions 1, 10, 19, and so on are all encrypted with the same monoalphabetic cipher. Thus, we can use the known frequency characteristics of the plaintext language to attack each of the monoalphabetic ciphers separately. The periodic nature of the keyword can be eliminated by using a nonrepeating keyword that is as long as the message itself. Vigenère proposed what is referred to as an autokey system, in which a keyword is concatenated with the plaintext itself to provide a running key. For our example, \\ key: deceptivewearediscoveredsav \\  plaintext: wearediscoveredsaveyourself \\ ciphertext: ZICVTWQNGKZEIIGASXSTSLVVWLA \\ Even this scheme is vulnerable to cryptanalysis. Because the key and the plaintext share the same frequency distribution of letters, a statistical technique can be applied. For example, e enciphered by e can be expected to occur with a frequency of $(0.127)^2 \approx 0.016$, whereas t enciphered by t would occur only about half as often. These regularities can be exploited to achieve successful cryptanalysis.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch3"

"Explain the significance of randomness in the one-time pad cipher for ensuring unbreakable security.","In the one-time pad cipher,randomness plays a crucial role in ensuring unbreakable security. An example illustrates this point effectively: Suppose we use a Vigenère scheme with 27 characters, including the space character, and employ a one-time key that is as long as the message. Consider the ciphertext ANKYODKYUREPFJBYOJDSPLREYIUNOFDOIUERFPLUYTS. Decrypting this ciphertext with two different keys produces two plausible plaintexts: \\ 1.

The unbreakable nature of the one-time pad lies in the fact that, if the actual key is generated randomly, there is no way to determine which plaintext corresponds to the intended message. Any plaintext of equal length to the ciphertext could be produced with a suitable key. Therefore, exhaustive searches of all possible keys would yield multiple legible plaintexts, with no means of identifying the intended one. The security of the one-time pad hinges entirely on the randomness of the key.

Key Distribution and Protection: Another daunting challenge is the distribution and protection of keys. For every message exchanged, both the sender and receiver require a key of equal length. Consequently, a massive key distribution problem arises.

Classical examples of stream ciphers include the autokeyed Vigenère cipher and the Vernam cipher. In an ideal scenario, the Vernam cipher would use a one-time pad, where the length of the keystream matches the length of the plaintext bit stream. With a truly random cryptographic keystream, this cipher becomes unbreakable, as it provides perfect secrecy. However, the challenge lies in securely distributing the keystream to both the sender and the receiver in advance through an independent and secure channel.Despite offering strong security guarantees, the use of a one-time pad introduces logistical challenges, especially for large-scale data traffic, due to the need for secure key distribution. This logistical issue can become insurmountable when dealing with extensive data communication needs.

"What is a stream cipher, and how does it differ from other encryption techniques? Discuss examples of classical stream ciphers and their ideal scenarios.","A stream cipher is a cryptographic method that encrypts digital data streams bit by bit or byte by byte. Unlike block ciphers, which operate on fixed-size blocks of data, stream ciphers process data continuously, encrypting or decrypting one element of the data stream at a time. Classical examples of stream ciphers include the autokeyed Vigenère cipher and the Vernam cipher. In an ideal scenario, the Vernam cipher would use a one-time pad, where the length of the keystream matches the length of the plaintext bit stream. With a truly random cryptographic keystream, this cipher becomes unbreakable, as it provides perfect secrecy. However, the challenge lies in securely distributing the keystream to both the sender and the receiver in advance through an independent and secure channel.Despite offering strong security guarantees, the use of a one-time pad introduces logistical challenges, especially for large-scale data traffic, due to the need for secure key distribution. This logistical issue can become insurmountable when dealing with extensive data communication needs. Accordingly, for practical reasons, the bit-stream generator must be implemented as an algorithmic procedure, so that the cryptographic bit stream can be produced by both users. In this approach, the bit-stream generator is a key-controlled algorithm and must produce a bit stream that is cryptographically strong. That is, it must be computationally impractical to predict future portions of the bit stream based on previous portions of the bit stream. The two users need only share the generating key, and each can produce the keystream." ,"orig","word","cipher","cns-ch4"
"What is a block cipher, and how does it compare to a stream cipher in terms of operation and usage of encryption keys?","A block cipher is a cryptographic algorithm that encrypts a fixed-size block of plaintext as a whole, producing a corresponding block of ciphertext with the same length. These algorithms typically operate on blocks of 64 or 128 bits. In contrast to stream ciphers, where data is encrypted or decrypted bit by bit or byte by byte, block ciphers process data in fixed-size blocks. Both block and stream ciphers rely on symmetric encryption keys, which are shared between the sender and the receiver. This ensures that both parties can encrypt and decrypt the data using the same secret key. While block ciphers operate on fixed-size blocks of data, they can be used to achieve the same effect as stream ciphers by employing specific modes of operation.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch4"
"Explain the concept of reversible and irreversible mappings in the context of block ciphers.","A block cipher operates on a plaintext block of $n$ bits to produce a ciphertext block of $n$ bits. For encryption to be reversible, each plaintext block must produce a unique ciphertext block, ensuring that decryption is possible. This unique transformation is called reversible, or nonsingular. In reversible mappings, each plaintext block is mapped to a distinct ciphertext block, ensuring one-to-one correspondence between plaintext and ciphertext. In contrast, irreversible mappings result in one or more plaintext blocks being mapped to the same ciphertext block, making decryption ambiguous. As an illustration, consider examples for $n=2$ bits. In a reversible mapping, each plaintext block (00, 01, 10, 11) is uniquely mapped to a ciphertext block, ensuring reversibility. However, in an irreversible mapping, one or more plaintext blocks (e.g., 10 and 11) may be mapped to the same ciphertext block, leading to ambiguity during decryption. Therefore, to ensure reversibility and avoid ambiguity, block ciphers typically employ reversible mappings. The following examples illustrate nonsingular and singular transformations for $n=2$ \begin{tabular}{cc} \multicolumn{2}{c}{ Reversible Mapping } \\ \hline Plaintext & Ciphertext \\ \hline 00 & 11 \\ 01 & 10 \\ 10 & 00 \\ 11 & 01 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \begin{tabular}{cc} \multicolumn{2}{c}{ Irreversible Mapping } \\ \hline Plaintext & Ciphertext \\ \hline 00 & 11 \\ 01 & 10 \\ 10 & 01 \\ 11 & 01 \\ \hline \end{tabular}","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch4"
"What is the logic behind a general substitution cipher for $n=4$?","In a general substitution cipher for $n=4$ bits, each 4-bit input (plaintext) can produce one of 16 possible input states. These input states are then mapped by the substitution cipher into a unique one of 16 possible output states, each represented by 4 ciphertext bits. Both the encryption and decryption mappings can be defined by tabulating the corresponding plaintext-ciphertext pairs.The encryption and decryption mappings can be defined by a tabulation, as shown below.\\ \begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Plaintext & Ciphertext \\\hline 0000 & 1110 \\ 0001 & 0100 \\ 0010 & 1101 \\ 0011 & 0001 \\ 0100 & 0010 \\ 0101 & 1111 \\ 0110 & 1011 \\ 0111 & 1000 \\ 1000 & 0011 \\ 1001 & 1010 \\ 1010 & 0110 \\ 1011 & 1100 \\ 1100 & 0101 \\ 1101 & 1001 \\ 1110 & 0000 \\ 1111 & 0111 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Ciphertext & Plaintext \\ \hline 0000 & 1110 \\ 0001 & 0011 \\ 0010 & 0100 \\ 0011 & 1000 \\ 0100 & 0001 \\ 0101 & 1100 \\ 0110 & 1010 \\ 0111 & 1111 \\ 1000 & 0111 \\ 1001 & 1101 \\ 1010 & 1001 \\ 1011 & 0110 \\ 1100 & 1011 \\ 1101 & 0010 \\ 1110 & 0000 \\ 1111 & 0101 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \\ This tabulation outlines the transformation rules between plaintext and ciphertext. The cipher operates on the principle of substituting each plaintext block with a corresponding ciphertext block based on the defined mapping. This general form of block cipher allows for any reversible mapping between plaintext and ciphertext, providing flexibility in encryption and decryption operations. Feistel refers to this type of cipher as the ideal block cipher because it allows for the maximum number of possible encryption mappings from the plaintext block.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch4"
"What practical problem arises with the ideal block cipher, especially when using a small block size like $n=4$?","The practical problem with the ideal block cipher, particularly when employing a small block size like $n=4$, is its vulnerability to statistical analysis of the plaintext, akin to classical substitution ciphers. This vulnerability stems not from the inherent weakness of substitution ciphers but from the limitation imposed by the small block size. When $n$ is sufficiently large and allows for arbitrary reversible substitutions between plaintext and ciphertext, the statistical characteristics of the plaintext become sufficiently obscured, making cryptanalysis infeasible. However, implementing and operating an arbitrary reversible substitution cipher, known as the ideal block cipher, with a large block size is impractical due to performance and implementation constraints. In such systems, the mapping itself serves as the key. For instance, in the case of $n=4$, the key length required to define the mapping is $(4 \text{ bits}) \times (16 \text{ rows}) = 64 \text{ bits}$. In general, for an $n$-bit ideal block cipher, the key length determined in this manner is $n \times 2^n$ bits. For a desirable block size of 64 bits, the necessary key length to resist statistical attacks would be $64 \times 2^{64} \approx 10^{21}$ bits.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch4"
"What approach did Feistel propose to approximate the ideal block cipher, and how does it differ from the ideal block cipher concept?","Feistel proposed the concept of a product cipher as an approximation of the ideal block cipher. In a product cipher, two or more simple ciphers are executed sequentially in a way that the final result, or product, is cryptographically stronger than any of the component ciphers alone. The key idea behind this approach is to develop a block cipher with a key length of $k$ bits and a block length of $n$ bits, allowing for a total of $2^k$ possible transformations, rather than the $2^n!$ transformations available with the ideal block cipher. Feistel's proposed cipher alternates between substitutions and permutations. Substitution involves replacing each plaintext element or group of elements with a corresponding ciphertext element or group, while permutation entails rearranging the sequence of plaintext elements without adding, deleting, or replacing any elements. This approach allows for the creation of a more robust and secure block cipher by leveraging both substitution and permutation operations.","orig","word","cipher","cns-ch4"
"Explain diffusion and confusion in the context of cryptography.","In cryptography, diffusion and confusion are two techniques proposed by Claude Shannon to frustrate statistical cryptanalysis.\\ Diffusion involves dissipating the statistical structure of the plaintext into long-range statistics of the ciphertext. This is achieved by ensuring that each plaintext digit affects the value of many ciphertext digits. In other words, each ciphertext digit is influenced by multiple plaintext digits. For example, in a message encryption scenario, diffusion can be implemented by an averaging operation, where each ciphertext letter is computed based on the sum of several successive plaintext letters. This process disperses the statistical characteristics of the plaintext, resulting in ciphertext with more equal letter frequencies compared to the plaintext. Additionally, digram frequencies also tend to be more evenly distributed. \\ An example of diffusion is to encrypt a message $M=m_1, m_2, m_3, \ldots$ of characters with an averaging operation: $$ y_n=\left(\sum_{i=1}^k m_{n+i}\right) \bmod 26 $$ \\ adding $k$ successive letters to get a ciphertext letter $y_n$. \nConfusion, on the other hand, aims to make the relationship between the plaintext and the ciphertext as complex as possible. It achieves this by substituting plaintext elements or groups of elements with corresponding ciphertext elements, or by permuting sequences of plaintext elements. This obscures any patterns or correlations between the plaintext and ciphertext, making it difficult for cryptanalysts to derive meaningful information.\nIn binary block ciphers, diffusion is typically achieved by repeatedly applying permutations on the data followed by applying functions to those permutations. This ensures that bits from different positions in the original plaintext contribute to multiple bits in the resulting ciphertext, further enhancing the security of the encryption process. \\ Both diffusion and confusion play crucial roles in modern block cipher design. By making the statistical relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext complex and obscuring the relationship between ciphertext statistics and the encryption key, diffusion and confusion collectively enhance the security of block ciphers. These concepts have become fundamental principles in the design of secure encryption algorithms, serving as the cornerstone of modern block cipher design.","orig","math","cipher","cns-ch4"
"Describe the encryption algorithm proposed by Feistel.","The encryption algorithm proposed by Feistel operates on a plaintext block of length \(2w\) bits and a key \(K\). The plaintext block is divided into two halves, \(LE_0\) and \(RE_0\), each of length \(w\) bits. These halves undergo \(n\) rounds of processing before combining to produce the ciphertext block.\\ Each round \(i\) of the algorithm takes as inputs the left and right halves \(LE_{i-1}\) and \(RE_{i-1}\) derived from the previous round, as well as a subkey \(K_i\) derived from the overall key \(K\). The subkeys \(K_i\) are distinct from \(K\) and from each other.\n\nThe structure of each round consists of two main operations: substitution and permutation. In the substitution step, a round function \(F\) is applied to the right half of the data \(RE_{i-1}\) using the subkey \(K_{i+1}\). This function \(F\) produces an output of length \(w\) bits. The output of \(F\) is then XORed with the left half of the data \(LE_{i-1}\), resulting in a new value for the left half of the data.\\ Following the substitution step, a permutation is performed by interchanging the two halves of the data. This structure, known as a Feistel network, is a specific form of the substitution-permutation network (SPN) proposed by Claude Shannon. The use of multiple rounds of substitution and permutation operations enhances the security of the encryption algorithm, making it resistant to cryptanalysis attempts.","orig","math","cipher","cns-ch4"
"Discuss the parameters and design features that influence the realization of a Feistel network.","The realization of a Feistel network depends on several parameters and design features: \\ 1. Block size: Larger block sizes generally result in greater security due to increased diffusion, but they may lead to reduced encryption/decryption speed. Traditionally, a block size of 64 bits was common, but the new AES uses a 128-bit block size. \\ 2. Key size: Larger key sizes enhance security by increasing resistance to brute-force attacks and providing greater confusion. While key sizes of 64 bits or less are now considered inadequate, 128 bits has become a common choice.\\ 3. Number of rounds: A single round of a Feistel cipher offers insufficient security, but multiple rounds enhance security. A typical number of rounds is 16. \\ 4. Subkey generation algorithm: The complexity of the subkey generation algorithm influences the difficulty of cryptanalysis.\\ 5. Round function \(F\): The complexity of the round function \(F\) also affects resistance to cryptanalysis.\\ Additionally, two other considerations are important in the design:\\ - Fast software encryption/decryption: The speed of algorithm execution is crucial, especially for software-based implementations.\\ - Ease of analysis: While the goal is to make the algorithm difficult to cryptanalyze, it's beneficial to ensure that the algorithm can be analyzed easily. A clear and concise explanation facilitates the identification of vulnerabilities and strengthens assurance in the algorithm's security. For instance, DES, despite its strength, lacks easily analyzed functionality.","orig","math","cipher","cns-ch4"
"Explain the Feistel decryption algorithm and demonstrate its validity with an example.","The process of decryption with a Feistel cipher is essentially the same as the encryption process. The rule is as follows: Use the ciphertext as input to the algorithm, but use the subkeys $K_i$ in reverse order. That is, use $K_n$ in the first round, $K_{n-1}$ in the second round, and so on, until $K_1$ is used in the last round. This is a nice feature, because it means we need not implement two different algorithms; one for encryption and one for decryption. For clarity, we use the notation $L E_i$ and $R E_i$ for data traveling through the encryption algorithm and $L D_i$ and $R D_i$ for data traveling through the decryption algorithm. At every round, the intermediate value of the decryption process is equal to the corresponding value of the encryption process with the two halves of the value swapped. Also,  let the output of the $i$ th encryption round be $L E_i \| R E_i\left(L E_i\right.$ concatenated with $\left.R E_i\right)$. Then the corresponding output of the $(16-i)$ th decryption round is $R E_i \| L E_i$ or, equivalently, $L D_{16-i} \| R D_{16-i}$. \\  After the last iteration of the encryption process, the two halves of the output are swapped, so that the ciphertext is $R E_{16} \| L E_{16}$. The output of that round is the ciphertext. \\ After the last iteration of the encryption process, the two halves of the output are swapped, so that the ciphertext is $R E_{16} \| L E_{16}$. The output of that round is the ciphertext. Now take that ciphertext and use it as input to the same algorithm. The input to the first round is $R E_{16} \| L E_{16}$, which is equal to the 32-bit swap of the output of the sixteenth round of the encryption process. \\ Now we would like to show that the output of the first round of the decryption process is equal to a 32-bit swap of the input to the sixteenth round of the encryption process. First, consider the encryption process. We see that \\ $$ \begin{aligned} & L E_{16}=R E_{15} \\ & R E_{16}=L E_{15} \oplus \mathrm{F}\left(R E_{15}, K_{16}\right) \end{aligned} $$ On the decryption side, $$ \begin{aligned} L D_1 & =R D_0=L E_{16}=R E_{15} \\ R D_1 & =L D_0 \oplus \mathrm{F}\left(R D_0, K_{16}\right) \\ & =R E_{16} \oplus \mathrm{F}\left(R E_{15}, K_{16}\right) \\ & =\left[L E_{15} \oplus \mathrm{F}\left(R E_{15}, K_{16}\right)\right] \oplus \mathrm{F}\left(R E_{15}, K_{16}\right) \end{aligned} $$ The XOR has the following properties: $$ \begin{aligned} {[A \oplus B] \oplus C } & =A \oplus[B \oplus C] \\ D \oplus D & =0 \\ E \oplus 0 & =E \end{aligned} $$ Thus, we have $L D_1=R E_{15}$ and $R D_1=L E_{15}$. Therefore, the output of the first round of the decryption process is $R E_{15} \| L E_{15}$, which is the 32-bit swap of the input to the sixteenth round of the encryption. This correspondence holds all the way through the 16 iterations, as is easily shown. We can cast this process in general terms. For the $i$ th iteration of the encryption algorithm, $$ \begin{aligned} & L E_i=R E_{i-1} \\ & R E_i=L E_{i-1} \oplus \mathrm{F}\left(R E_{i-1}, K_i\right) \end{aligned}$$ Rearranging terms: $$ \begin{aligned} & R E_{i-1}=L E_i \\ & L E_{i-1}=R E_i \oplus \mathrm{F}\left(R E_{i-1}, K_i\right)=R E_i \oplus \mathrm{F}\left(L E_i, K_i\right) \end{aligned} $$ Thus, we have described the inputs to the $i$ th iteration as a function of the outputs. Finally, we see that the output of the last round of the decryption process is $R E_0 \| L E_0$. A 32-bit swap recovers the original plaintext, demonstrating the validity of the Feistel decryption process. Note that the derivation does not require that $\mathrm{F}$ be a reversible function. To see this, take a limiting case in which $\mathrm{F}$ produces a constant output (e.g., all ones) regardless of the values of its two arguments. The equations still hold.","orig","math","cipher","cns-ch4"
"Explain the significance and historical evolution of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) until the introduction of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 2001.","Until the introduction of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 2001, the Data Encryption Standard (DES) was the most widely used encryption scheme. DES was issued in 1977 by the National Bureau of Standards, now the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), as Federal Information Processing Standard 46 (FIPS PUB 46).The algorithm itself is referred to as the Data Encryption Algorithm (DEA).6 For DEA, data are encrypted in 64-bit blocks using a 56-bit key. The algorithm transforms 64-bit input in a series of steps into a 64-bit output. The same steps, with the same key, are used to reverse the encryption. Over the years, DES became the dominant symmetric encryption algorithm, especially in financial applications. In 1994, NIST reaffirmed DES for federal use for another five years; NIST recommended the use of DES for applications other than the protection of classified information. In 1999, NIST issued a new version of its standard (FIPS PUB 46-3) that indicated that DES should be used only for legacy systems and that triple DES (which in essence involves repeating the DES algorithm three times on the plaintext using two or three different keys to produce the ciphertext) be used. Because the underlying encryption and decryption algorithms are the same for DES and triple DES, it remains important to understand the DES cipher.","orig","math","cipher","cns-ch4"
"What are the fundamental components and processes involved in the Data Encryption Standard (DES) encryption scheme, and how does it utilize a 56-bit key to encrypt a 64-bit plaintext?","In the DES  encryption scheme, there are two inputs to the encryption function: the plaintext to be encrypted and the key. In this case, the plaintext must be 64 bits in length and the key is 56 bits in length. The processing of the plaintext proceeds in three phases. First, the 64-bit plaintext passes through an initial permutation (IP) that rearranges the bits to produce the permuted input. This is followed by a phase consisting of sixteen rounds of the same function, which involves both permutation and substitution functions. The output of the last (sixteenth) round consists of 64 bits that are a function of the input plaintext and the key. The left and right halves of the output are swapped to produce the preoutput. Finally, the preoutput is passed through a permutation [IP-1] that is the inverse of the initial permutation function, to produce the 64-bit ciphertext. With the exception of the initial and final permutations, DES has the exact structure of a Feistel cipher. The 56 bit key is used in the following way. Initially, the 56 bit key is passed through a permutation function. Then, for each of the sixteen rounds, a subkey (Ki) is produced by the combination of a left circular shift and a permutation. The permutation function is the same for each round, but a different subkey is produced because of the repeated shifts of the key bits.", "orig","math","cipher","cns-ch4"

Specifically, altering just one bit in the plaintext or one bit in the key should lead to multiple bits being altered in the ciphertext. This effect is highly desirable as it enhances the security of the encryption scheme. If the avalanche effect is strong, it becomes more challenging for an attacker to deduce information about the plaintext or the key from the ciphertext.

"Discuss the security concerns surrounding the Data Encryption Standard (DES), particularly focusing on key size and the nature of the algorithm.","The security concerns surrounding DES primarily revolve around two main aspects: key size and the nature of the algorithm. \\ 1. With a relatively small key length of 56 bits, DES offers approximately $7.2 * 10^16$ possible keys, making a brute-force attack seem impractical at first glance. However, advancements in technology have raised significant concerns regarding the feasibility of breaking DES. Diffie and Hellman proposed as early as 1977 that a parallel machine with 1 million encryption devices, each capable of performing one encryption per microsecond, could potentially break DES within about 10 hours. This estimate was based on the assumption that half of the key space needs to be searched on average. While such specialized hardware was costly in the past, today's commercial off-the-shelf processors pose a serious threat to DES security. Modern multicore computers can achieve rates of 1 billion key combinations per second, and hardware-based instructions from companies like Intel and AMD further accelerate encryption processes. Recent analyses suggest that contemporary supercomputers can achieve rates of $10^13$ encryptions per second, significantly shortening the time required for a brute-force attack. For example, a single PC can potentially break DES in about a year, while today's supercomputers may find a key in approximately an hour. In contrast, key sizes of 128 bits or greater are considered effectively unbreakable using brute-force methods. Even with a hypothetical speedup of $10^12$, breaking a code with a 128-bit key would still take over 100,000 years. Therefore, the relatively small key size of DES, coupled with advancements in computing technology, raises serious concerns about its security in modern cryptographic environments. \\ 2. Another concern is the possibility that cryptanalysis is possible by exploiting the characteristics of the DES algorithm.The focus of concern has been on the eight substitution tables, or S-boxes, that are used in each iteration . Because the design criteria for these boxes, and indeed for the entire algorithm, were not made public, there is a suspicion that the boxes were constructed in such a way that cryptanalysis is possible for an opponent who knows the weaknesses in he S-boxes. This assertion is tantalizing, and over the years a number of regularities and unexpected behaviors of the S-boxes have been discovered. Despite this, no one has so far succeeded in discovering the supposed fatal weaknesses in the S-boxes.","orig","math","numbertheory","cns-ch4"
"What is a timing attack, and how does it exploit vulnerabilities in encryption or decryption algorithms?","A timing attack is a method of obtaining information about the key or the plaintext by observing the time taken for a given implementation to perform decryptions on various ciphertexts. This attack relies on the fact that encryption or decryption algorithms often exhibit slight variations in processing time for different inputs. For instance, a timing attack reported by [HEVI99] aims to deduce the Hamming weight, which is the number of bits equal to one, of the secret key. While this technique represents only an initial step towards revealing the actual key, it demonstrates the potential for extracting sensitive information through timing analysis. Despite efforts to explore avenues for timing attacks, DES appears to offer considerable resistance against such attacks, as noted by the authors. However, ongoing research continues to investigate potential vulnerabilities in DES and other symmetric ciphers like triple DES and AES. Despite the intrigue surrounding timing attacks, the current consensus suggests that their success against DES or other robust symmetric ciphers remains unlikely.","orig","math","numbertheory","cns-ch4"
"What do the number of rounds contribute to the cryptographic strength of a Feistel cipher, and how do they influence the design process?","The number of rounds plays a crucial role in determining the cipher's resistance to cryptanalysis. A higher number of rounds typically increases the complexity of cryptanalytic efforts, even when employing relatively weak functions F. The choice of the number of rounds should be such that known cryptanalytic techniques require more effort than a simple brute-force key search attack. For example, in the case of DES with its 16 rounds, a differential cryptanalysis attack is slightly less efficient than brute force, requiring $2^{55.1}$ operations compared to $2^55$ for brute force. If DES had 15 or fewer rounds, differential cryptanalysis would require less effort than a brute-force key search. This criterion is attractive, because it makes it easy to judge the strength of an algorithm and to compare different algorithms. In the absence of a cryptanalytic breakthrough, the strength of any algorithm that satisfies the criterion can be judged solely on key length.","orig","math","numbertheory","cns-ch4"
"What are the key considerations in designing the function F for a Feistel block cipher, and why are they important?", "The function F plays a crucial role in providing confusion in a Feistel block cipher, and its design requires careful consideration to enhance the security of the cipher. One fundamental criterion is nonlinearity, which makes it challenging to reverse the substitution performed by F. A more nonlinear F complicates cryptanalysis efforts, making it more difficult to break the cipher. While there are various measures of nonlinearity, the general principle is that F should be resistant to approximation by linear equations. Another important consideration is the avalanche effect, where a small change in the input should lead to significant changes in the output, ensuring robust encryption. The strict avalanche criterion (SAC) further refines this notion, stating that each output bit of F should change with a probability of 1/2 when any single input bit is inverted, strengthening the avalanche properties. Additionally, the bit independence criterion (BIC) emphasizes the importance of output bit independence when any single input bit is inverted, further enhancing the confusion function's effectiveness. These criteria, along with nonlinearity, contribute to the overall security of the Feistel cipher by ensuring that F operates in a highly unpredictable manner, thwarting attempts at cryptanalysis.", "orig","math","numbertheory","cns-ch4"

Three critical aspects of block cipher design continue to shape cryptographic strength: the number of rounds, the design of the function F, and key scheduling. \\ 1. The Number of Rounds: The number of rounds determines the complexity of the encryption process and significantly impacts cryptographic strength. Increasing the number of rounds enhances security by making cryptanalysis more challenging. Feistel's work with DES emphasized the importance of selecting an appropriate number of rounds to resist attacks while balancing computational efficiency. \\ 2. Design of the Function F: The function F, responsible for confusion within the cipher, must exhibit nonlinearity to thwart cryptanalysis attempts. Feistel's approach highlighted the significance of designing F to be resistant to linear approximations, ensuring robust encryption and decryption processes. \\ 3. Key Scheduling: The process of generating subkeys from the main encryption key is critical for ensuring security. Feistel's design incorporated key scheduling algorithms to produce distinct subkeys for each round, enhancing the complexity of the encryption process and strengthening overall security.Despite the evolution of cryptographic techniques, these core principles established by Feistel and the DES design team continue to guide modern block cipher design, emphasizing the importance of robust encryption, nonlinear functions, and secure key management.", "orig","math","numbertheory","cns-ch4"
"Consider a Feistel cipher composed of sixteen rounds with a block length of 128 bits and a key length of 128 bits. Suppose that, for a given \( k \), the key scheduling algorithm determines values for the first eight round keys, \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_8 \), and then sets \( k_9 = k_8 \), \( k_{10} = k_7 \), \( k_{11} = k_6 \), and so on, until \( k_{16} = k_1 \). Suppose you have a ciphertext \( c \). Explain how, with access to an encryption oracle, you can decrypt \( c \) and determine \( m \) using just a single oracle query. This shows that such a cipher is vulnerable to a chosen plaintext attack. (An encryption oracle can be thought of as a device that, when given a plaintext, returns the corresponding ciphertext. The internal details of the device are not known to you and you cannot break open the device. You can only gain information from the oracle by making queries to it and observing its responses.)", "Because of the key schedule, the round functions used in rounds 9 through 16 are mirror images of the round functions used in rounds 1 through 8. From this fact we see that encryption and decryption are identical. We are given a ciphertext \( c \). Let \( m' = c \). Ask the encryption oracle to encrypt \( m' \).

Each element of $S_n$ is represented by a permutation $\pi$ of the integers $1,2, \ldots, n$. It is easy to demonstrate that $S_n$ is a group:\n(A1) If $\pi, \rho \in S_n$, then the composite mapping $\pi \cdot \rho$ is formed by permuting the elements of $\rho$ according to the permutation $\pi$. For example, $\{3,2,1\} \cdot\{1,3,2\}=\{2,3,1\}$. The notation for this mapping is explained as follows: The value of the first element of $\pi$ indicates which element of $\rho$ is to be in the first position in $\pi \cdot \rho$; the value of the second element of $\pi$ indicates which element of $\rho$ is to be in the second position in $\pi \cdot \rho$; and so on.

"From a group of 5 women and 7 men, how many different committees consisting of 2 women and 3 men can be formed?","To solve this problem using a Chain of Thought approach, let's break it down step by step. \n Firstly, we need to determine the number of ways to choose 2 women from a group of 5. This is represented by the combination \(\binom{5}{2}\), which equals \(\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \frac{5 \cdot 4}{2 \cdot 1} = 10\). Similarly, the number of ways to choose 3 men from a group of 7 is given by \(\binom{7}{3}\), which equals \(\frac{7!}{3!(7-3)!} = \frac{7 \cdot 6 \cdot 5}{3 \cdot 2 \cdot 1} = 35\). \n Multiplying these two values together, we find that there are \(10 \times 35 = 350\) possible committees consisting of 2 women and 3 men. \n \n Now, let's consider the scenario where 2 of the men refuse to serve together. Out of the 35 possible groups of 3 men, there are 5 groups that contain both feuding men. Subtracting these from the total, we have 30 groups of 3 men that do not contain both feuding men. \n With these 30 groups of men, there are still 10 ways to choose the 2 women. Therefore, there are \(30 \times 10 = 300\) possible committees in this case. \n Hence, we have calculated that there are 300 possible committees when 2 of the men refuse to serve together.","orig","math","probability","fcp-ch1"
"In a set of \(n\) antennas, \(m\) of which are defective and \(n-m\) are functional (with all defectives and functionals indistinguishable), how many linear orderings are there in which no two defectives are consecutive?","To approach this problem, let's visualize the situation. First, let's line up the \(n-m\) functional antennas among themselves. Now, to ensure that no two defectives are consecutive, we need to place the \(m\) defective antennas in the spaces between the functional antennas. \n There are \(n-m+1\) possible positions between the \(n-m\) functional antennas where we can place the defective antennas (as illustrated in Figure 1.1 by carets). We need to select \(m\) out of these positions to place the defective antennas. \n Therefore, the total number of linear orderings where no two defectives are consecutive is given by \(\binom{n-m+1}{m}\).","orig","math","probability","fcp-ch1"

Now, there are \(\binom{n-1}{r-1}\) ways to form a group of size \(r\) that includes object 1, since we are selecting \(r-1\) objects from the remaining \(n-1\) objects. Additionally, there are \(\binom{n-1}{r}\) ways to form a group of size \(r\) that does not include object 1.

"How many subsets are there of a set consisting of \(n\) elements?","To determine the number of subsets of a set with \(n\) elements, we can utilize the binomial theorem. The binomial theorem states that \((a+b)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} a^{n-k} b^k\). If we consider \(a = b = 1\), then \((1+1)^n = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k} 1^{n-k} 1^k = \sum_{k=0}^{n} \binom{n}{k}\). This equals the total number of subsets, which is \(2^n\).

How many different divisions are possible?","To determine the number of different divisions, we can employ the generalized version of the basic counting principle. Starting with the first group, there are \(\left(\begin{array}{c}n \\ n_1\end{array}\right)\) possible choices. For each choice of the first group, there are \(\left(\begin{array}{c}n-n_1 \\ n_2\end{array}\right)\) possible choices for the second group, and so on.

How many different divisions are possible?", "In this scenario, the order of the two teams is irrelevant, unlike cases where there are distinct team labels like 'Team A' and 'Team B'. Here, we focus solely on the division into two groups of 5 children each. \n To find the total number of possible divisions, we utilize the concept of combinations. We calculate the number of ways to select 5 children from the total of 10 to form the first group, which is the same as the number of ways to choose the remaining 5 children for the second group. \n Using the combination formula, we find that there are $\frac{10!}{5!5!}$ ways to divide the children into two teams. However, since the order of the teams is irrelevant, we need to account for this by dividing by $2!$. \n Hence, the total number of possible divisions is $\frac{10!}{5!5! \cdot 2!} = 126$.","orig","math","probability","fcp-ch1"
