"What are groups and rings in the context of algebraic structures?","Groups and rings are algebraic structures. Groups are defined by a simple set of properties and are easily understood. Rings are a subset of groups and possess additional properties. Both groups and rings can be further differentiated, with each successive subset adding additional properties and complexity.","orig","word","cipher","cns"

"What is a group in algebraic structures?","A group $G$, sometimes denoted by $\{G, \cdot\}$, is a set of elements with a binary operation denoted by $\cdot$ that associates to each ordered pair $(a, b)$ of elements in $G$ an element $(a \cdot b)$ in $G \times G$, such that the following axioms are obeyed:\n(A1) Closure: If $a$ and $b$ belong to $G$, then $a \cdot b$ is also in $G$.\n(A2) Associative: $a \cdot(b \cdot c)=(a \cdot b) \cdot c$ for all $a, b, c$ in $G$.\n(A3) Identity element: There is an element $e$ in $G$ such that $a \cdot e=e \cdot a=a$ for all $a$ in $G$.\n(A4) Inverse element: For each $a$ in $G$, there is an element $a^{\prime}$ in $G$ such that $a \cdot a^{\prime}=a^{\prime} \cdot a=e$.\n\n The operator $\cdot$ is generic and can refer to addition, multiplication, or some other mathematical operation.","orig","math","cipher","cns"
"What is $S_n$ in the context of permutation groups?","Let $N_n$ denote a set of $n$ distinct symbols that, for convenience, we represent as $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$. A permutation of $n$ distinct symbols is a one-to-one mapping from $N_n$ onto $N_n$. Let $S_n$ be the set of all permutations of $n$ distinct symbols. Each element of $S_n$ is represented by a permutation $\pi$ of the integers $1,2, \ldots, n$. It is easy to demonstrate that $S_n$ is a group:\n(A1) If $\pi, \rho \in S_n$, then the composite mapping $\pi \cdot \rho$ is formed by permuting the elements of $\rho$ according to the permutation $\pi$. For example, $\{3,2,1\} \cdot\{1,3,2\}=\{2,3,1\}$. The notation for this mapping is explained as follows: The value of the first element of $\pi$ indicates which element of $\rho$ is to be in the first position in $\pi \cdot \rho$; the value of the second element of $\pi$ indicates which element of $\rho$ is to be in the second position in $\pi \cdot \rho$; and so on. Clearly, $\pi \cdot \rho \in S_n$.\n(A2) The composition of mappings is also easily seen to be associative.\n(A3) The identity mapping is the permutation that does not alter the order of the $n$ elements. For $S_n$, the identity element is $\{1,2, \ldots, n\}$.\n(A4) For any $\pi \in S_n$, the mapping that undoes the permutation defined by $\pi$ is the inverse element for $\pi$. There will always be such an inverse. For example $\{2,3,1\} \cdot\{3,1,2\}=\{1,2,3\}$.","orig","math","cipher","cns"

"What is the method for finding the multiplicative inverse of an element in GF(p)?" ,"For small values of $p$, the multiplicative inverse of an element in GF(p) can be found by constructing a multiplication table, where the desired result can be read directly. However, for large values of $p$, this approach is not practical. Instead, for $a$ and $b$ in $Z_p$, if $a$ and $b$ are relatively prime, then $b$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $a$. That is, if $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$, then $b$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $a$. The extended Euclidean algorithm can be used to compute $b^{-1}$ efficiently in this case. Using the extended Euclidean algorithm we have: $$ ax+by=d=\operatorname{gcd}(a, b) $$ Now, if $\operatorname{gcd}(a, b)=1$, then we have $a x+b y=1$. Using the basic equalities of modular arithmetic, we can say $$ \begin{gathered} {[(a x \bmod a)+(b y \bmod a)] \bmod a=1 \bmod a} \\0+(b y \bmod a)=1\end{gathered} $$ But if $b y \bmod a=1$, then $y=b^{-1}$.
